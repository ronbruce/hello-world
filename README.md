# hello-world
This is my first repository.
I am intested in UX design.
My goal with GitHub is to store my design, notes, and collaborate with others.
Currently I am interning at Google as a webdeveloper.
We are learning Java. 
Next we will be learning Javascript.
I currently reside in New York City.
